# Fibonacci-Sequence
The Fibonacci numbers are a sequence of numbers where each number after the first two is a sum of the prior two. As an illustration, here is a short sequence given starting values of (0, 1) is (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13).  Write a program to generate and print the first n terms of the Fibonacci sequence where n >=1.
